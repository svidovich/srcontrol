# TODO: Add parsers for the different types of metric files
# According to the redhat guide, there are three types:
#
# Value metrics: Just a value in a file
#
# Key-Value paired metrics: Metrics of the form
# key1 = value1
# ...
# keyK = valueK
# ...
# keyN = valueN
#
# And chain types, which are a whole fucked up mess of their own
